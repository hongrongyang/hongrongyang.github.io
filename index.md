I am a master student in Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, affiliated to the [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Insititute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yinliang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sppii6gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Xuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=B-I9FY8AAAAJ). My interests are in the areas of deep reinforcement learning, with a focus on applications to energy control, particularly electric vehicles fleets management and individual EV battery management system. **I believe that DRL is one of the most principal control method in the future.** You can find my [CV](https://hongrongyang.github.io/CV.pdf) here.
