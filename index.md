I am a master student in Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, affiliated to the [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Insititute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yinliang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sppii6gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Xuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=B-I9FY8AAAAJ). My CV could be found [here](https://hongrongyang.github.io/CV.pdf).

I am broadly interested in the **learning-based control**, with applications to **energy systems**. My current researches are as follows: 
1. Design the **safe and distributed control methods** for the large and complex systems, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a better understanding of collective intelligence.â€‹
2. Explore the impact of the **coordination** of vehicle-to grid technology and the shared energy storage on **carbon emissions and market prices**.
3. Investigate how to charge the EV batteries **safely** (avoid the battery lithium precipitation), **quickly** (allocate the charging energy for charging & heating) and **environmental friendly** (reduce battery aging and energy consumption) in **cold environments**.

My previous research focused on the **deep reinforcement learning algorithms**, with applications to electric vehicles fleets management and individual EV battery management system. The relevant papers could be found in [Publications page](https://hongrongyang.github.io/Publications).
