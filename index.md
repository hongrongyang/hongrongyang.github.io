I am a master student in Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, affiliated to the [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Insititute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yinliang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sppii6gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Xuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=B-I9FY8AAAAJ). My CV could be found [here](https://hongrongyang.github.io/Resume.pdf)(*last update: Nov. 2023*).

I am broadly interested in the **learning-based control**. My previous research focused on the **deep reinforcement learning**, with applications to EV fleets management and individual EV battery management system. The relevant papers could be found in [Publications page](https://hongrongyang.github.io/Publications). 

**My current researches are as follows**: 
1. Design the safe and distributed learning-based control methods for the complex and large systems.â€‹
2. Explore the impact of the coordination of vehicle-to grid technology and the shared energy storage on the carbon emissions and market prices.
3. Investigate how to charge the EV batteries safely (avoid the lithium precipitation), quickly (allocate the energy for charging & heating) and environmental friendly (reduce the energy consumption) in cold environments.
